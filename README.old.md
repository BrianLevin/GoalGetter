## About <a name="about"></a>

Our team sought to create an app that allows users to log their goals on an app that also allows them to connect with other users with the same or similar goals. 

------------------
## Inspiration <a name="inspiration"></a>

We were inspired a number of organizations that seek to help people reach whatever their goals may be. Additionally, we all had the shared ethos of wanting to do something to help people ourselves. The more we read about the idea, the more convinced we became. This section would become a novel if we were to put all of our inspirations here. That said, we drew ideas from places like Alcoholics/Narcotics Anonymous, Positivepsychology.com, and a number of other places that have done similar work. 

------------------
## Usage 

We seek to connect users who want to keep track of their disparate goals and connect with other users with potentially similar goals. The idea is one of general accountability.

## To-do list (future additions): <a name="todo"></a>

* We would like to do a number of things to get beyond out Minimal Viable Product (MVP), including enabling users to connect with other users with similar goals. creating connective capabilities, whether those be via text or video or some other means, etc. Time and work constraints mostly prevented us from delving deeper into these ideas, but we all plan to continue working towards them after classes are finished. We also welcome all ideas and would ask anyone interested to open an "Issue" on github to do so.
